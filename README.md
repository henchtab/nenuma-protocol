# Broker SamayƒÅ: A secure, peer-to-peer binary options platform built on TON blockchain.

Broker Samaya is a TON-native binary options trading platform that simplifies cryptocurrency trading for newcomers. The platform allows users to make straightforward up/down price predictions while enabling peer-to-peer market making. It features automated smart contracts for security, instant payouts, and a unique Dealers program where users can earn rewards by bringing in new traders. Targeting mobile-first users in Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America, the platform offers low entry barriers with fees starting at 0.5% per trade and a tiered subscription model for advanced features.

The project aims to solve three key problems: the complexity of DeFi platforms, the inaccessibility of derivatives trading for newcomers, and the security issues plaguing traditional binary options platforms. By leveraging TON blockchain's security and focusing on simplicity, Broker Samaya positions itself to capture the influx of new users from popular TON applications like Notcoin and Hamster Combat.
